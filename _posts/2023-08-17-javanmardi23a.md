title: Conformal Prediction with Partially Labeled Data
abstract: "While the predictions produced by conformal\r prediction are set-valued,
  the data used for\r training and calibration is supposed to be\r precise. In the
  setting of superset learning or\r learning from partial labels, a variant of weakly\r
  supervised learning, it is exactly the other way\r around: training data is possibly
  imprecise\r (set-valued), but the model induced from this data\r yields precise
  predictions. In this paper, we\r combine the two settings by making conformal\r
  prediction amenable to set-valued training data. We\r propose a generalization of
  the conformal prediction\r procedure that can be applied to set-valued training\r
  and calibration data. We prove the validity of the\r proposed method and present
  experimental studies in\r which it compares favorably to natural baselines."
